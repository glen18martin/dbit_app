<div class="head"><h1>About</h1></div>
<br>
<div class="para"><h5>St. John Bosco was born in Turin, Italy in 1815. When he was two years old, his father died. This future saint, raised by his mother, experienced the pains of poverty at a very tender age. John's future work was inspired by a dream he had at the age of nine. He wanted to become a priest, especially to assist youth. In order to pursue his dream John had to leave home at a young age to join the city school. Being bigger than his classmates, he was often the object of much ridicule. Little did they know at what cost John finished his schooling. After school he worked as a tailor, a cobbler or a waiter, often studying by candle light late into the night. On completing his education he began his studies to be a priest.
John Bosco was ordained a priest at the age of twenty-six. He was now called Don [Father] Bosco. He immediately began his work with orphans. He opened a hospice for boys where his mother served as the housekeeper. He not only fed the homeless boys whom he took in but also provided them with opportunities for livelihood skills. He spent long hours teaching them to read and write; he also taught them tailoring and shoemaking and quickly set up a printing press. Above all, he created a family atmosphere of trust and caring. Those who helped him were amazed at the transformation in several youngsters.
Soon those associated with Don Bosco and his work began to accept him as their father and guide. Some expressed their desire to become like him. And so, the Salesian Society consisting of priests and lay brothers was born. (The word 'Salesian' was derived from St Francis de Sales, a saintly bishop noted for his gentle kindness and holiness. Don Bosco chose him as his personal model and later as the patron of his society.)
The greatest gift that Don Bosco has left posterity is his unique way of educating, a method that was inspired by his one magnificent obsession: "It is enough to know that you are young and abandoned for me to love you very much."
More than a century after the death of Don Bosco, thousands of people have dedicated themselves to the continuation if his apostolic love for young people all over the world. Their mission is to be "signs and bearers of God's love to the young."
The “Salesians of Don Bosco” is an international society founded by Don Bosco. Catholic priests and Brothers who are members of the Society work for the development and education of the young especially those most at risk. Through its 3000 Schools, Colleges, Technical schools and youth centers in 125 countries, the Salesians of Don Bosco serve all young people irrespective of religious differences or social inequalities.
In India, Don Bosco Educational institutions are spread all over the country and are in great demand. The style of education consists in involving young people, their parents or guardians and the educators in a family atmosphere. The method adopted is one that was lived and handed down by Don Bosco himself -“The Preventive System” based on Reason, Faith in God and Loving Kindness. The goal is Integral Education. This embraces developing physical and aesthetic talents, training in occupational skills, fostering intellectual skills and competence, furthering cultural development and integration with others, including moral uprightness.</h5></div>

<div class="head"><h1>Institute</h1></div>
<br>
<div class="para"><h5>Fr. Tony D'Souza, the Provincial of the Mumbai province of the Salesians of Don Bosco entrusted the task of building the Don Bosco Institute of Technology (DBIT) to Fr. Mario Vaz, now its Director and his team comprising Fr. Jeffrey Fernandes the Principal of S.J.I.T.I and Fr. Anthony Santarita the then administrator. In the mind of the Salesians, DBIT would have to be an engineering college with a difference and so right from the start emphasis was laid on good infrastructure and well qualified staff that would cultivate and nurture every entrant into the portals of DBIT and inspire them to excellence. This meant setting up policies and processes that would ensure this objective.
We are fortunate in having Dr. B. S. Bhatt, former principal of VJTI as our advisor who guides us every step of the way. Mr. Albert D'souza, a friend of the Salesians was instrumental in ensuring that every requirement for the engineering college was met.
In Dr. S.Krishnamoorthy, the Salesians found a man not only highly qualified and experienced but also a person with sound values and pedagogical principles that were akin to the philosophy of Don Bosco's system of education. Innovation, quality systems and processes that focus on development and growth for both faculty and students, are goals that are constantly being pursued.
It is our cherished hope that every student who passes out of DBIT will be self-reliant and a socially conscious engineer.</h5></div>

<div class="head"><h1>History</h1></div>
<br>
<div class="para"><h5>Mumbai is a large industrial city of India. Considering this fact, the Salesians who were established at Matunga since 1928 decided to start a technical school. This was done to cater to the growing demand for skilled workers in the industrial sector. Fr. Maschio and Fr. Rubio took charge of finding a plot for this purpose. They finally settled on a plot at Kurla shown to them by Rev. Peter Pereira, the parish priest of Holy Cross Church, Kurla. Now on this plot are three excellent Technical Institutes known to Mumbai.
ST. JOSEPH'S ITI
His Eminence Valerian Cardinal Gracias laid the foundation stone for the St. Joseph's Industrial Training Institute on January 30, 1963 and the first session of the training school started on August 27, 1965. St. Joseph's I.T.I was the first institute set up by the Salesians at Kurla. It started with 56 students and today has a strength of 198 students. The I.T.I provides training in trades such as Fitters, Machinists, Motor Vehicle Mechanic, Electrical maintenance, Electronics, A.C. maintenance etc. These courses usually run for a period of two years. Till date it has produced a number of quality technicians and is now one of the premier ITIs in Mumbai.
DON BOSCO MARITIME ACADEMY (D.B.M.A)
In 1998 , the Salesians thought of expanding and extending their services, from the technical field to the sea world. Don Bosco Maritime Academy was set up to train prospective & serving seagoing personnel, as per the STCW Convention of International Maritime Organization (IMO). It was a driving ambition to make sure that students turn out to be excellently trained, competent and committed Engineers. DBMA thus became the first institute to start the 'ATS' (Alternate Training Scheme) course. This unique venture, a three-year program, provided those aspiring to be marine engineers, an entry into the Merchant Navy. DBMA is committed to producing Engineers who will be among the best in the Marine Industry.Don Bosco Institute of Technology (D.B.I.T)
DON BOSCO INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (D.B.I.T)
With globalization and a radical shift of the industry into the Electronic and IT fields, the need of the hour was excellent engineers. With its vast experience in managing educational institutes and especially technical ones, it was natural that the Salesians enter the engineering field. Thus DBIT came into existence in 2001.</h5></div>

<div class="head"><h1>Management</h1></div>
<br>
<div class="para"><h5>The Don Bosco Institute of Technology is managed by the Bombay Salesian Society. The Bombay Salesian Society is a registered charitable trust that manages various charitable and educational activities in the state of Maharashtra. Its educational institutions are usually named after Don Bosco who is the founder of the Salesians who are Roman Catholic Priests and Brothers.</h5></div>
